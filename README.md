# Power Delete Suite

Why use the Power Delete Suite instead of the other mass reddit deletion scripts?

1. It was built by /u/j0be, a well known reddit user with a long reddit history and moderates several large subreddits
2. There is complete privacy built in. There are no callbacks to any personal servers, no tracking, or logging. You are completely anonymous.
3. There is NO NEED to use never ending reddit to load as many comments / submissions. This script uses the actual Reddit API endpoints to edit and delete instead of automating click on delete and edit buttons. 
4. It's pretty damn thorough. It will first load your submissions page(s), then do searches with the reddit search api, then load up your comments page(s). This makes sure to grab everything it can possibly find.
5. It has FILTERS! You can make choices about what you want deleted. Filters include:
 * choosing which subreddits to perform actions in
 * excluding gilded comments and posts
 * excluding saved comments and posts
 * excluding mod distinguished comments and posts
6. When editing comments, you choose what you want it to be edited to. I'm not going to do some self promo bullshit on your account. What you edit it to is your own business. 
 * As a note, if you are both editing AND deleting, it makes sure to edit the comment / self post before deleting it.
